# My Python Journey begins

I started learning Python around November/December 2021 when I was still in Calabar working at Wessa Pharmacy during my National Youth Service.

I applied for a scholarship with Dev Careers Africa on Twitter and got admitted to learn Python on the Progate platform.

This repository contains codes from my early days.
